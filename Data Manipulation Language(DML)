-- Data Manipulation Language --: 

               DML is used for inserting, deleting, and updating data in a database. 
               It is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. It includes INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 

   INSERT

               Insert statement is used to insert data in a SQL table. Using the Insert query, we can add one or more rows to the table. Following is the syntax of the MySQL INSERT Statement.

                                    INSERT INTO table_name
                                    (attribute1, attribute2, ...)
                                    VALUES(val1, val2, ...)

               Let's take a quick instance for understanding this better. Suppose that we need to insert 2 rows {"myName3", 2, true} and {"myName4", 28, false}. This is how we would accomplish that:

                                    insert into my_table
                                    values("myName3", 5, false),
                                    ("myName4", 51, true);
                                    
                                    Output:
                                    
                                    Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)

               We don't necessarily have to include all column values. We can for example omit the age column as shown below:

                                    insert into my_table
                                    (first_name, employed)
                                    values("myName4", true);
                                    
                                    Output:
                                    
                                    Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.01 sec)
                                    
                                    This is also a fine example of how we insert just one row.

   UPDATE :

               This command is used to make changes to the data in the table. Its syntax is:

                                    UPDATE table_name
                                    SET column1 = val1,
                                    column2 = val2,
                                    ...
                                    WHERE CLAUSE;

               How about we update the employment status of myName of age 12 which has it as NULL? This is how we achieve it:

                                    update my_table
                                    set employed=true
                                    where age=12;
                                    
                                    Output:
                                    
                                    Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.01 sec)

               Let's batch-update all our rows without filtering them on any condition. 
               Suppose we want to increment the value of every row in the age column. 
               The following query is what we need:

                                    update my_table
                                    set age = age + 1;
                                    
                                    Output:
                                    
                                    Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)

   DELETE :

               This command is used to remove a row from a table. the syntax for delete is
               
                                    DELETE FROM table_name
                                    WHERE CLAUSE;
               
               The where clause is optional. To delete the row with first_name "myName5 run this query:
               
                                    delete from my_table
                                    where first_name = "myName5";
               
                                    Output:
                                    
                                    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

               It is to be noted that omitting the use where clause results in the emptying of the table just as truncating does.
