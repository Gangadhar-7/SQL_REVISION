--Types of SQL Commands


   DDL(Data Definition Language): To make/perform changes to the physical structure of any table residing inside a database, DDL is used. 
                                  These commands when executed are auto-commit in nature and all the changes in the table are reflected and saved immediately.

   DML(Data Manipulation Language): Once the tables are created and the database is generated using DDL commands, 
                                    manipulation inside those tables and databases is done using DML commands. 
                                    The advantage of using DML commands is, that if in case any wrong changes or values are made, they can be changed and rolled back easily.

   DQL(Data Query Language):      Data query language consists of only one command upon which data selection in SQL relies.
                                  The SELECT command in combination with other SQL clauses is used to retrieve and fetch data from databases/tables based on certain conditions applied by the user.

   DCL(Data Control Language): DCL commands as the name suggests manage the matters and issues related to the data controller in any database. 
                               DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.

   TCL(Transaction Control Language): Transaction Control Language as the name suggests manages the issues and matters related to the transactions in any database. 
                                      They are used to roll back or commit the changes in the database.



   

Data Manipulation Language
DML is used for inserting, deleting, and updating data in a database. It is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. It includes INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Let's discuss these commands one at a time.

INSERT

Insert statement is used to insert data in a SQL table. Using the Insert query, we can add one or more rows to the table. Following is the syntax of the MySQL INSERT Statement.

INSERT INTO table_name
(attribute1, attribute2, ...)
VALUES(val1, val2, ...)

Let's take a quick instance for understanding this better. Suppose that we need to insert 2 rows {"myName3", 2, true} and {"myName4", 28, false}. This is how we would accomplish that:

insert into my_table
values("myName3", 5, false),
("myName4", 51, true);

Output:

Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)

We don't necessarily have to include all column values. We can for example omit the age column as shown below:

insert into my_table
(first_name, employed)
values("myName4", true);

Output:

Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.01 sec)

This is also a fine example of how we insert just one row.

UPDATE

This command is used to make changes to the data in the table. Its syntax is:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = val1,
column2 = val2,
...
WHERE CLAUSE;

How about we update the employment status of myName of age 12 which has it as NULL? This is how we achieve it:

update my_table
set employed=true
where age=12;

Output:

Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.01 sec)

Let's batch-update all our rows without filtering them on any condition. Suppose we want to increment the value of every row in the age column. The following query is what we need:

update my_table
set age = age + 1;

Output:

Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)

DELETE

This command is used to remove a row from a table. the syntax for delete is

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE CLAUSE;

The where clause is optional. To delete the row with first_name "myName5 run this query:

delete from my_table
where first_name = "myName5";

Output:

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

It is to be noted that omitting the use where clause results in the emptying of the table just as truncating does.

Data Query Language
DQL commands are used for fetching data from a relational database. They perform read-only queries of data. The only command, 'SELECT' is equivalent to the projection operation in relational algebra. It command selects the attribute based on the condition described by the WHERE clause and returns them.

Select is one of the most important SQL commands. It is used to retrieve data from a database. One can fetch either the entire table or some data according to specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table. With the SELECT clause of a SELECT command statement, we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and, optionally, which column headings we prefer to see above the result table.

The select clause is the first clause and is one of the last clauses of the select statement that the database server evaluates. The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result set, we need to know all of the possible columns that could be included in the final result set.

The syntax for the SELECT statement is:

SELECT column1 as c1
column2 as c2
...
from table_name;

'as c1' implies that the result table column that holds the data from column1 of the original table, will be identified as 'c1' and its usage is optional.

To get the age of all our rows, we would run the first of the following query:

select age as myAge
from my_table;

select * from my_table;

Output:


| myAge |
| ----- |
|  47   |

| first_name | age | employed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| myName     | 47     | 1     |


Notice something weird in the second query?

Firstly there's an asterisk in place of specifying a column. What it does is signal to the DBMS that the user has requested all the data in the table, i.e. entry of every column for every row. Therefore the entire table is returned as it is.

Secondly, we haven't used the operator here. thus the returned table columns have retained their original labels.

We can select data as per our requirements by filtering. We have an array of methods, operators, functions, etc for this purpose. Suppose we need to fetch only those rows which qualify a certain criterion. We use a 'where' clause to fulfill this.

Assume the present state of our table is as shown in the image below.

select * from my_table;

Output:


| first_name | age | employed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| myName     | 47     | 1     |
| maName1 | 10 | 0 |
| myName2 | 20 | 0 |
| myName3 | 32 | 1 |


Let's say that we need to fetch all rows where the age is strictly greater than 20. The query that we need is as follows:

select * from
my_table where age>20;

Output:


| first_name | age | employed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| myName     | 47     | 1     |
| myName2 | 32 | 1 |


yes; it works!

To extract all the rows where the name matches a certain pattern we use the 'like' operator. The following snippet shows its action:

select * from my_table
where first_name like "myName_";

Output:


| first_name | age | employed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| myName0     | 10     | 1     |
| maName1 | 10 | 0 |
| myName2 | 20 | 0 |


'like' is an operator used for pattern matching. It uses two special characters embedded in the string to be matched; The percent sign '%' represents zero, one, or any number of characters, while the underscore sign '_' represents a single character.

In the previous example, we used underscore, and therefore all rows except the first were returned because 'myName_' implies a matching string of the form 'myName' + an additional character. The last 3 strings are of this form and hence are matched, unlike the first one which does not have any additional character present at last.

Similarly, we can obtain all the rows in the first_name field which ends with zero ('0').

select * from my_table
where first_name like "%0";

Output:


| first_name | age | employed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| myName0     | 10     | 0     |


Data Control Language
DCL is used to access the stored data. It is used to revoke and grant the user the required access to a database. In the database, this language does not have the feature of rollback. It is a part of the structured query language (SQL).

It helps in controlling access to information stored in a database. It complements the data manipulation language and the data definition language. It is the simplest of three commands.

It provides the administrators, to remove and set database permissions to desired users as needed. These commands are employed to grant, remove and deny permissions to users for retrieving and manipulating a database. There are two relevant commands under this category: grant and revoke.

GRANT

GRANT is a command used to provide access or privileges on the database objects to the users.

SYNTAX

GRANT PRIVILEGES
ON OBJECT
TO USER;

grant-command-types

SELECT:

To grant Select Privilege to a table named “tableName", the user name is "userName", and the following GRANT statement should be executed.

GRANT SELECT
ON tableName
TO 'userName'@'localhost';

Granting multiple privileges to a user:

To grant multiple Privileges to a user named “username" in table “tableName”, the following GRANT statement should be executed:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
ON tableName
TO 'userName'@'localhost';

Granting all the privileges to a user:

To Grant all the privileges to a user named “userName” in a table “tableName”, the following Grant statement should be executed.

GRANT ALL
ON tableName
TO 'userName'@'localhost';

Granting a privilege to all users:

To Grant a specific privilege to all the users in a table “tableName" this Grant statement should be executed.

GRANT SELECT
ON tableName
TO '*'@'localhost';

REVOKE

Once you have granted privileges, you may need to revoke some or all of these privileges. To do this, you can run a revoke command. You can revoke any combination of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES, ALTER, or ALL.

REVOKE privileges
ON object
FROM user;

Object is the name of the database object that you are revoking privileges for. In the case of revoking privileges on a table, this would be the table name. Username of the user that will have these privileges revoked.

Suppose we need to revoke delete permission for the 'tableName' table' from a user named 'userNamed', the following would be the query.

REVOKE DELETE
ON tableName
FROM userName;

To remove every permission use 'ALL'.

REVOKE ALL
ON tableName
FROM userName;

Transaction Control Language
TCL includes statements that are used to manage the changes that are made from DML statements. It enhances the transactional nature of SQL. The TCL commands in SQL are:

COMMIT: It's a SQL command used in the transaction tables or database to make the current transaction or database statement permanent. It shows the successful completion of a transaction. If we have successfully executed the transaction statement or a simple database query, we want to make the changes permanent. We need to perform the commit command to save the changes, and these changes become permanent for all users. Furthermore, once the commit command is executed in the database, we cannot regain its previous states in which it was earlier before the execution of the first statement.

SYNTAX

commit;

ROLLBACK: Undoes any changes made to the database. ROLLBACK is the SQL command that is used for reverting changes performed by a transaction. When a ROLLBACK command is issued it reverts all the changes since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

SYNTAX

ROLLBACK;

SAVEPOINT: This command creates a point in your transaction to which you can roll back. It is a command in SQL that is used with the rollback command. It is a command in Transaction Control Language that is used to mark the transaction in a table.

SYNTAX

SAVEPOINT some_name;
